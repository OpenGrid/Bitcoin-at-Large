Bitcoin-at-Large
================

I've noticed people in the Bitcoin community asking if a site existed that compiled all the legal information about Bitcoin into one location. I hope this site can become what they are looking for.

I'm a horrible web dev, so I need your help. Every little bit counts. There is a lot of information out there, and I'd like to have it all on this site.

Please direct any questions to matt@bitcoinatlarge.com.
